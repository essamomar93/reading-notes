### Why is the Context API useful?
- The Context API is a React structure that enables you to exchange unique details and assists in solving prop-drilling from all levels of your application, and Context API is a way to enable components to share some data without explicitly passing via each component manually. 


### Can a component outside of a provider get its context?
- To access a React context outside of the render function, we can use the useContext hook. We create the UserContext by calling the React. createContext method with a default context value. Then in the Users component, we call the useContext hook with UserContext to accxess the current value of UserContext.


### What are some common use cases for using the Context API?
- Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language. 


### Describe “Context Hell”
- Like the callback hell, usual when jQuery was used for everything, the React Context hell is the nasty code you get taking advantage of the React Context API.
