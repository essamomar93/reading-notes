# Advanced State with Reducers : 

### How can we ensure that an effect hook runs only once? 
- you can pass an empty array ( [] ) as a second argument . 

### Can useState() update more than one state variable at the same time? 
- yes it can . 

### Is useState() synchronous? 
- yes its synchronous. 

## Vocabulary  : 

- State Hook :  (function) that allows you to have state variables in functional components.  
- Component Lifecycle :Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases. The three phases are: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting. 

### useReducer hook : 
` const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialArg, init); `  
- An alternative to `useState`. Accepts a reducer of type `(state, action) => newState`, and returns the current state paired with a dispatch method. 
- example from the useState section : 
   ```
   const initialState = {count: 0};

   function reducer(state, action) {
   switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return {count: state.count + 1};
    case 'decrement':
      return {count: state.count - 1};
    default:
      throw new Error();
   }
   }

   function Counter() {
   const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
    return (
    <>
      Count: {state.count}
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({type: 'decrement'})}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({type: 'increment'})}>+</button>
    </>
   );
   } 
   ```

### Ultimate Guide to useReducer : 
- `seReducer` is one of the additional Hooks that shipped with `React 16.8`. An alternative to the `useState Hook`, it helps you manage complex state logic in React applications. 
- `useReducer` is used to store and update states, just like the `useState Hook`. It accepts a `reducer` function as its first parameter and the initial state as the second.
- Exambel : 
    ```
     const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
     switch (action.type) {
      case 'ITEMS_REQUEST':
         return Object.assign({}, state, {
            isLoading: action.payload.isLoading
         })
      case â€˜ITEMS_REQUEST_SUCCESS':
         return Object.assign({}, state, {
            items: state.items.concat(action.items),
            isLoading: action.isLoading
         })
      default:
         return state;
     }
     }
     export default reducer; 
    ```
