# Component Lifecycle  

### Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?
- becuse we write the file bath inside the react 

### If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?
 ```
  1. Outside the <BrowserRouter/>
  2. Inside the <BrowserRouter />, outside a <Route />
  3. Inside a <Route />
  ``` 
- ` Inside the <BrowserRouter />, outside a <Route /> ` 

### What does routing do with the components that were rendered when a new route is requested 
- it will rendered  new route  

### What does props.children contain?
- contains an <img> that is receiving some props 

### How do `useState()` and `this.setState()` differ?  
- Unlike the setState method found in class components, useState does not automatically merge update objects 


## Vocabulary  

- State Hook: (function) that allows you to have state variables in functional components. 
- Mounting and Un-Mounting : Mounting is the phase in which our React component mounts on the DOM ,Unmounting. The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is removed from the DOM . 



#### Example for effects hook
- 
   ``` 
   import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

   function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
   
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });
  
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
  }
 ```
