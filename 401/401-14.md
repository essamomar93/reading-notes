# Event Driven Architecture : 

### What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
- Standard queues provide best-effort ordering which ensures that messages are generally delivered in the same order as they are sent. Occasionally (because of the highly-distributed architecture that allows high throughput), more than one copy of a message might be delivered out of order.

- FIFO queues offer first-in-first-out delivery and exactly-once processing: the order in which messages are sent and received is strictly preserved.
  
### How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
- Include a nonce with each sent message, (nonce is like a one time password or id).
- The client sends a confirmation message that they received successfully.


### What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?
- Event-driven from end to end. 


### How do you test an event driven system?
1. Ensure supporting topics exist.
2. Start the application under test (“application” here could mean Kafka Streams, Kafka connectors, Samza, etc.)
3. Send some input events.
4. Wait until the application has finished processing the test input.
5. Assert that it looks right.

## Vocabulary : 

- FIFO Queue: is a queue that operates on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) principle.
  
- Pub/Sub : is an asynchronous messaging service that decouples services that produce events from services that process events.
