# Trees: 
- Tree is a widely used abstract data type that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes.

  - Each element in the tree is called a node, which has a value and a pointer to the next node.
  - The first node is called the root which is the also first parent, then we have child node.
  - Nodes next to each other are called siblings.
  - Any node without a child is called a leaf node.
  - An edge is the link between a parent and a child node.
  - height is the number of edges from the root to the farthest leaf.
  - K: A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in 
  - a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.

- A binary tree is where a node's maximum number of children is two (right and left).

- A binary search tree is a type of binary tree that naturally stays sorted.

  - Every left child must be less than its parent.
  - Every right child must be greater than its parent.

- A binary search tree aka BST is balanced when its right and left sub-trees have roughly the same amount of nodes.

  - If sub-trees have the exact same amount, it makes it a perfect tree, which is rare.
  - Otherwise, it is called an unbalanced tree.
  - In worst case scenarios, a BST can become so unbalanced it becomes degenerate, where it basically becomes a linked list. (not a tree anymore)
