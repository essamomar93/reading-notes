# Linked Lists :
- A linked list is similar to a low level array structure... each element in the list is called a node, and it can reference (has a pointer to) the next node in the list (singly list).

- A doubly list is when each node references the next and previous node... and a circular list is when the last node (tail) references the first (the head) or another node.

- Linked lists advantages: faster insertion and removal of elements (nodes) with a Big O(1), while doing that with normal array is a Big O(n) which is slower.

Arrays advantages: faster in getting an element by index with a Big O(1), while in linked lists it is slower with a Big O(n) because nodes are accessed sequentially starting from the first node... resulting in a linear process. That is linked lists are classified as a linear data structure.
