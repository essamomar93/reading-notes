# Solving Problems :- 

## Common mistakes: 

- The most mistakes of those is the improper allocation of time. 
- did not spending upfront time to make sure something is done right 
-  try to solve a programming problem is they try to start writing code as soon as possible. 
- Another big mistake is trying to over solve the solution on the first iteration.

## A simple set of steps : 
1. Read the problem completely twice:  
 You want to make sure you completely understand the problem.  A good test of this is whether or not you can explain the problem to someone else.   

 2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data:  
 you solve the problem with at least three different inputs to make sure you really understand your solution and that it will work for more than one case.  

 3. Optimize the manual steps:  
  if there is another way you can solve the problem easier, or if there are some steps you can cut our or simplify.  
   
 4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code:  
   By doing this, we can know exactly what the structure of the code we are going to write is going to look like which makes the job of filling in the actual code later trivial. 

 5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code:    
 All we do here is take each comment and convert it into a real line of code.  

 6. Optimize the real code:    
  make sure all your variables are named with long meaningful names.
