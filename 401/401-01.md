## what Array.map() does:  
-  method creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element. 
  
## what Array.reduce() does :  
-  method executes a reducer function for each value of an array. 
 
## Provide code snippets showing how to use superagent() to fetch data from a URL and log the result: 
1. With normal Promise .then() syntax:
 ```
     const getApi =  (req, res) => {
     superagent.get('url').then(response => {
     res.send(response.data)
      })
     };
 ```
2. Again with async / await syntax
     ```
     const getApi = async (req, res) => {
     await superagent.get('url').then(response => {
     res.send(response.data)
      })
    };
   ```   
  ## Explain promises as though you were mentoring a Code 301 level student :  
  - A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value.  

  ## Are all callback functions considered to be Asynchronous? Why or Why Not? 
   callback doesn't make a function asynchronous, It iterates over each item and calls the function once per item. This can be used among other things to calculate total value from a property of each item.
