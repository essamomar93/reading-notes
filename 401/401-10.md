# Stacks & Queues:- 

## Stacks: 

### Methods:

- push : insert at top
- pop : remove at top, raises exception is queue is empty
- peek : view value of the top node, raises exception if stack is empty 
- isEmpty : returns true if empty 
- Top : This is the top of the stack.

### Concept:

  1. LIFO → Last In First Out:
     - This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.
  2. FILO → First In Last Out
     - This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

## Queues:

### Methods:

- enqueue : added to queue 
- dequeue : removed from queue, raises exception is queue is empty 
- peek : view value of the front/first node, raises exception if queue is empty 
- isEmpty : returns true if empty 
- Front : This is the front/first Node of the queue.
- Rear : This is the rear/last Node of the queue.

### Concept:

1. FIFO → First In First Out: 
 - This means that the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue. 
2. LILO → Last In Last Out
  - This means that the last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue.
