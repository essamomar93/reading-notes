if you want to link paje within you site you can use relative links 

## Htmal layout : 

### CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box: 

Controlling the Position of Elements :
* Normal flow : Every block-level element appears on a new line, causing each item to appear lower down the page than the previous one.
* Relative Positioning : This moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow, shifting it to the top right, bottom, or left of where it would have been placed. 
* Absolute positioning : This positions the element in relation to its containing element. 
* Fixed Positioning : This is a form of absolute positioning that positions the element in relation to the browser window, as opposed to the containing element. 
* Floating Elements : Floating an element allows you to take that element out of normal flow and position it to the far left or right of a containing box.
