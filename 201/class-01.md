# Html & Javascript
>## Html:
 HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.  
  It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

## Structure: 
An HTML Document is mainly divided into two parts: 
 
#### HEAD:This contains the information about the HTML document. For Example, Title of the page, version of HTML, Meta Data etc.
#### BODY: This contains everything you want to display on the Web Page.

## Extra Markup:

At this point, we have covered the main
tags that fit nicely into groups and
sections.


* DOCTYPES : tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.
<!DOCTYPE html> 

* Comments:  
ex:   
 Using<!-- -->
* ID Attribute:  attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.  
ex:  
<p>any paragraphe inside </p>  


* Class Attribute:  attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.  
ex:  
<p class="name for the class"></p>
 
* Block Elements:   
ex:
<div>
<ul>  
<li>1</li>  
<li>2</li>  
</ul>  
</div>  

* Inline Elements:  
ex:
<span class="name for class">text</span>  
* IFrames:  
<iframe
width="100"
height="100"
URL">
</iframe>   
  


## HTML5 Layou:  
its set ofelements that help define the structure of a page.

* Headers & Footers:  <header> <footer>  

* Navigation : <nav>  

* Articles: <article>  

* Asides: <aside>  

* Sections: <section>  

* Heading grope :<hgroup>  

* Figures : <figure>  
  

1. The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.

2. Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements. 

3. To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google. 

## Process & Design: 
process that you can use when you are creating a new website.

1. Ask question:   
you must ask some question for the client like "Who is the Site For" or " What Your Visitors are
Trying to Achieve" What Information
Your Visitors Need". 
2. Site Maps:  
its allow you to plan the structure of a site.   
when you have the informathion that you need to pild your web site you wil start with maps .  
3. WireFrames:  
it is a simple sketch of the webpaje.
